%% Code to plot correlations between the trace and relevant Hamming weights

% This script aims to provide some preliminary insights on the per-sequence
% measured traces intended for use in model building. It takes in data of
% the form:
% input: 3x1 cell array, each containing an Nx2 matrix representing the
%   first and second input to the first, second and third instruction in 
%   the sequence.
% output: 3x1 cell array, each containing an Nx1 matrix representing the
%   output of the first, second and third instruction in the sequence
%   (where applicable).
% oplabels: 3x1 cell array containing the operation codes representing the
%   sequence.
% traces: NxM matrix of trace measurements corresponding to the inputs and
%   instruction sequence.

%% Load data and compute transitions:

% Load trace data (note that our example set isn't very good; ideally input
% a better one):
load('exampleDataCorr.mat');
% Mean-centre:
traces = traces-repmat(mean(traces,2),1,size(traces,2));
% Count the number of traces:
numtraces = size(traces,1);

% Compute all the various transitions (for the correlation graphs):
inputT = repmat({nan(numtraces,2)},1,3);
outputT = repmat({nan(numtraces,1)},1,3);
for i = 1:3
    if sum(isnan([output{i};output{mod(i,3)+1}]))==0
        outputT{i} = bitxor(output{i},output{mod(i,3)+1});
    end
    for j = 1:2
        if sum(isnan([input{i}(:,j);input{mod(i,3)+1}(:,j)]))==0
            inputT{i}(:,j) = bitxor(input{i}(:,j),input{mod(i,3)+1}(:,j));
        end
    end
end
